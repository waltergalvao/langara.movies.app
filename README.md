# The Assignment

For our assignment, we will be making a movies app with React. We will be using an open/public movies API to do this.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">**Setup Steps:**</span>

1\. Go to **[https://www.themoviedb.org/](https://www.themoviedb.org/)**Â Register an account to get an API key.

2\. Create your React project

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">**IMPORTANT (PLEASE READ):**</span>

**1\. Use v3 of the API and authenticate your requests using your API Key [https://developers.themoviedb.org/3](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3)**

**2\. API endpoints to be used (all GET endpoints):**

**Movies**

*   **now playing**
*   **popular**
*   **top rated**
*   **upcoming**

**Search**

*   **movie**
*   **multi**
*   **tv**

**TV**

*   **airing today**
*   **on the air**
*   **popular**
*   **top_rated**

**3\. Do NOT use any of the wrapper libraries to make requests to the API, instead use the native fetch function/axios npm package. Marks will be deducted if wrapper libraries are used.**

4\. Do NOT use react hooks. Use the traditional react class container component structure which I have covered in class.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">**Desired Functionality:**</span>

Create three tabs. The first and third tabs should fetch from the movie and tv endpoints respectively. There should be a dropdown box displayed with the sub type within that respective endpoint. Upon selecting another selection from that dropdown box, the list of results should update to reflect the updated response from the new query. Likewise, when selecting another tab the results list should update to display the updated media and search type. When the search results tab is clicked, it should initially display a message prompting the user to enter a search query term nothing is entered in the input box. When the user starts to enter a search query, it should prompt the user to initiate a search. If the search yields no results, there should be a corresponding message displayed for that. There should be a dropdown box in the search form which is used to modify the type of search being done.
